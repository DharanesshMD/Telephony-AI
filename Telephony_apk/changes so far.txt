# Summary of Changes Made to `MainActivity.java`

## 1. **Initial Setup and Permissions**
- Added runtime permission requests for:
  - `READ_PHONE_STATE`
  - `READ_CALL_LOG`
- Implemented a method to check and request all permissions at once on first launch.

## 2. **User Guidance for Xiaomi/MIUI**
- Created a dialog to guide users through enabling Autostart and other necessary settings.
- Added checks to ensure the app continues to prompt for permissions until all are granted.

## 3. **Defensive Programming**
- Added null checks for `TextView` initializations to prevent crashes if the layout is incorrect.
- Wrapped risky code (like starting services and showing dialogs) in try/catch blocks to log errors.

## 4. **Autostart Permission Handling**
- Implemented a dialog that instructs users to enable Autostart in MIUI settings.
- Ensured that the app does not get stuck in a loop by not re-opening the Autostart settings after the user returns.

## 5. **Logging for Debugging**
- Added logging statements to capture errors and null references, aiding in debugging crashes.

## 6. **Code Structure**
- Refactored the permission request logic to be more user-friendly and efficient.
- Created a `continueSetup()` method to handle the setup flow after returning from system settings.

## 7. **Sequential Permission Flow and UI Enhancements**
- Replaced `checkAndRequestAllPermissions()` with `requestNextPermissionOrSetting()` to manage a sequential, step-by-step permission request flow.
- Utilized `currentPermissionStep` to guide the user through basic permissions, notification access, battery optimization, autostart, and final steps.
- Improved user experience by presenting each request individually and waiting for user acceptance.
- Updated `onRequestPermissionsResult` and `onActivityResult` to advance `currentPermissionStep` and continue the flow after user interaction with permission/setting prompts.
- Added `import android.annotation.Nullable;` to resolve compilation issues related to `@Nullable` annotation.

## 8. **Dependency Management**
- Corrected import statements for `@Nullable` and `@NonNull` annotations to `androidx.annotation.Nullable` and `androidx.annotation.NonNull` respectively.
- Added `androidx.annotation:annotation:1.7.0` dependency to `app/build.gradle` to resolve compilation issues.

## 9. **"Final Steps Window" Fix**
- Modified `requestNextPermissionOrSetting` to conditionally skip the "Final Steps" dialog if all core permissions are already granted at `currentPermissionStep == 4`, proceeding directly to starting the `CallCounterService`.

## 10. **Persistent Autostart Dialog Fix**
- Introduced `KEY_AUTOSTART_ADDRESSED` `SharedPreferences` key in `MainActivity.java` to track if the autostart permission has been addressed.
- Modified `showAutostartDialogIfNeeded()` to check this preference and set it to `true` when the user interacts with the dialog (either by continuing or skipping), preventing repeated prompts.

## 11. **Persistent Battery Optimization Dialog Fix**
- Introduced `KEY_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATION_ADDRESSED` `SharedPreferences` key in `MainActivity.java` to track if the battery optimization prompt has been addressed.
- Modified `requestNextPermissionOrSetting()` to check this preference and set it to `true` when the user interacts with the dialog (either by going to settings or skipping), preventing repeated prompts.

### Example Code Snippets

#### Permission Request Logic
```java
private void checkAndRequestAllPermissions() {
    List<String> missingPermissions = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String perm : REQUIRED_PERMISSIONS) {
        if (ActivityCompat.checkSelfPermission(this, perm) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            missingPermissions.add(perm);
        }
    }
    if (!missingPermissions.isEmpty()) {
        ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(this, missingPermissions.toArray(new String[0]), PERMISSION_REQUEST_CODE);
        return;
    }
    // Continue with other setup...
}
```

#### Autostart Dialog
```java
private void showAutostartDialogIfNeeded() {
    if (autostartDialogShown) return;
    autostartDialogShown = true;
    new AlertDialog.Builder(this)
        .setTitle("Enable Autostart (MIUI)")
        .setMessage("To ensure Call Counter works reliably, please enable Autostart for this app in the next screen. After enabling, return here and tap Continue.")
        .setCancelable(false)
        .setPositiveButton("Continue", new DialogInterface.OnClickListener() {
            @Override
            public void onClick(DialogInterface dialog, int which) {
                // Open Autostart settings
            }
        })
        .setNegativeButton("Skip", null)
        .show();
}
```

### Next Steps
- If the app continues to crash, please provide the crash log from the logcat file you mentioned. This will help identify the exact cause of the issue.
